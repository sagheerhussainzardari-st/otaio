                                          Mr. Jensen, the founder of Adzum, came to us with an
                                          idea and sought our help in bringing it to life. He
                                          wanted to establish a digital marketing firm.

                                             very foundation; and keeping the outlandish cost
                                             associated with such an endeavor, we pitched a
                                             partnership proposal. A white-labeling agreement
                                             was reached by which he would outsource the
                                             production to our firm-Outsource To Asia.
